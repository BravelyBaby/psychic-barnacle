Welcome — I'm learning to code and building small projects to get better every day.

## About Me
- 🔭 Current focus: JavaScript, Python, HTML & CSS, and Git. Also leveling up OBS scenes, Notion workflows, and small automations that save real time.  
- 🏛 Day job: Louisiana attorney and Chief of Staff to Public Service Commissioner Davante Lewis — I work on disability policy, utilities, and practical government problem solving.  
- 🧠 Building: CharShares, Life of Landry, Notion dashboards, Canva systems, and digital products that help families and advocates get organized.  
- 🌱 Learning by shipping: tiny web apps, helper scripts, overlay components for stream scenes, and data tools that turn messy inputs into clean decisions.  
- 🤝 Open to: beginner-friendly pair programming, small collabs, code reviews, and civic tech that improves accessibility, disabled life, and Medicaid navigation.  
- 💬 Ask me about: disability rights, Louisiana policy, caregiving, content ops, brand kits, OBS setup, or how to turn a kitchen-table idea into a working template.  
- 🧩 Fun fact: I can talk Down syndrome, reality TV, and pop-culture crossovers all day, then refactor your checklist into a Notion database before the credits roll.  
- ❤️ Accessibility: default to captions, alt text, and CamelCase hashtags. If it is not accessible, it is not done.  
- 🌍 Based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

## Toolbox
- JavaScript & TypeScript (basics, clean patterns, DOM fundamentals)  
- Python (small automations, data cleanup, quick scripts)  
- HTML & CSS (responsive layouts, utility classes, component styling)  
- Git & GitHub (branching, PRs, issues, starter Actions)  
- Node.js & Express (simple APIs and webhooks)  
- React (essentials for small front ends and overlay components)  
- Accessibility (semantics, ARIA, alt text, captions)  
- OBS (browser sources, scene building, lightweight automation)  
- Notion API (intake forms, data syncing, dashboards)  
- Testing: Jest & pytest (unit and smoke level)  
- Data handling: JSON & CSV, fetch patterns, pagination basics  
- Dev environment: VS Code tasks, basic Docker hello world

## Featured Project
- [psychic-barnacle](https://github.com/BravelyBaby/psychic-barnacle)  
  🔧 What it is right now: responsive HTML & CSS, small JavaScript utilities, and a Node + Express stub that serves JSON — simple screens for meds, supplies, appointments, tasks, and notes.  
  🛠 What I'm practicing: Git branching and PRs, starter GitHub Actions for lint/test, environment secrets with dotenv, fetch + pagination, ARIA and keyboard navigation, captions and alt text defaults, Prettier & ESLint on pre-commit, and Jest smoke tests.  
  🎯 Why it exists: a safe sandbox to test BravelyBaby caregiving pieces without touching production.  
  📌 Core workflows to prove out:
  - Med schedule and logging with time-based reminders, export to PDF/CSV.  
  - Supply tracker with par levels and quick-add shopping list.  
  - Appointment prep, visit notes, and follow-up tasks synced to a timeline.  
  - Care team directory with roles, phone/portal links, and emergency script cards.  
  - Document vault placeholders for IEPs, care plans, letters, and templates.  
  ♿️ Accessibility & safety goals: semantic HTML, ARIA where appropriate, large tap targets, offline-first friendly, local storage with optional cloud sync, plain-language labels.  
  🚀 Next steps: convert widgets to React, add Notion API sync for links/content, package an OBS browser source for stream overlays, wire a minimal PWA shell, and deploy to Vercel with preview builds for each PR.

## How I like to work
- Ship small pieces with frequent commits, clear messages, and tight scopes.  
- Keep a living README that explains the why, the what, and the how in plain language for others (and future me).  
- Start with accessibility: write alt text, use semantic HTML, and use CamelCase hashtags for readability.  
- Open a branch per task, write focused PRs, and request reviews with a short checklist.  
- Prefer simple, documented tools over clever magic; comments beat mysteries.  
- Track work in Notion with one source of truth, link commits and issues, and close the loop after merge.  
- Automate the boring parts with Prettier, ESLint, basic tests, and a starter GitHub Actions workflow.  
- Ask for and give feedback that is specific, kind, and actionable — step-by-step wins.  
- Treat data with care: environment variables for secrets, minimal logs, and no sensitive data in repos.  
- Optimize for real users: quick prototypes first, then refine with real-world friction notes.  
- Keep meetings short and async by default; write decisions down for future reference.

## What I like to test
- Faster intake forms and smoother onboarding flows.  
- Advocacy toolkits and caregiver templates that real families can use.  
- Good first issues in a11y, health policy, and family-centered tooling.  
- Small automations that save real time and reduce repetitive tasks.  
- Keyboard navigation, focus order, and screen reader semantics.  
- Offline-friendly patterns and simple data exports to CSV or PDF.  
- Notion sync for forms and dashboards plus JSON-powered content.  
- Stream overlays as browser sources with clear captions and alt text.
